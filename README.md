1. The layouts folder is where you define your site's look and feel.
1. The static directory holds your CSS, JavaScript files, images, and any other assets that aren't generated by Hugo.
1. The themes directory holds any themes you download or create. You can use the layouts folder to override or extend a theme you've downloaded.
